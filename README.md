# Product-Price-Analysis
This project involves loading and cleaning a dataset of Walmart product listings. The data was then used to analyze price trends over time for different product models and manufacturers, including visualizing these trends using line plots. The project also attempted to use the Gemini API to analyze the price trends and identify patterns or anomalies.
